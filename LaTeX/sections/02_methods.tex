\subsection{Data}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The used data for this project is the SwissImage RS data from the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo).
It is a raster dataset with a resolution of 0.1m containing four bands: RGB and NIR.
In order to cover the area of interest (AOI) 6 tiles of the dataset are needed.
Over this large AOI there are three areas labeled with the corresponding landcover categories.
This labeled data was provided by a team of researchers from the ZHAW. The three
areas are distributed over an industrial area (132493m\textsuperscript{3}), 
a residential area (82824m\textsuperscript{3}) and a rural area (82702m\textsuperscript{3}).
There are 10 different landcover categories in total shown in \autoref{fig:landcover_categories}.

In a first step the data was processed using ArcGIS Pro. The process included a few steps implemented as
a model \autoref{fig:processing_model}.
