\subsection{Data}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The used data for this project is the SwissImage RS data from the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo).
It is a raster dataset with a resolution of 0.1m containing four bands: RGB and NIR.
In order to cover the area of interest (AOI) 6 tiles of the dataset are needed.
Over this large AOI there are three areas labeled with the corresponding landcover categories.
This labeled data was provided by a team of researchers from the ZHAW. The three
areas are distributed over an industrial area, a residential area and a rural area.
There are 10 different landcover categories in total:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ConstructionSite
    \item Building
    \item BuildingDistortion
    \item GreenAreas
    \item RoadAsphalt
    \item Forest
    \item WaterBasin
    \item Path
    \item MeadowPasture
    \item SealedObjects
\end{itemize}








and on the other side a dataset generated by a team of researchers from the ZHAW concerning a ongoing project in the region of
the canton of Basel-Landschaft. The SwissImage RS data are six raster datasets with a resolution of 0.1m containing four bands: 
RGB and NIR. The dataset from the ZHAW is a feature dataset containing the landcover classification for three areas within 
the area of interest.

\subsection{Data Processing}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In a first step the data was processed using ArcGIS Pro. The process included a few steps implemented as
a model \autoref{fig:processing_model}.
