\subsection{Data and Data Processing}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The used data for this project is at one side the SwissImage RS data from the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo)
and on the other side a dataset generated by a team of researchers from the ZHAW concerning a ongoing project in the region of
the canton of Basel-Landschaft. The SwissImage RS data are six raster datasets with a resolution of 0.1m containing four bands: 
RGB and NIR. The dataset from the ZHAW is a feature dataset containing the landcover classification for three areas within 
the area of interest. In a first step the data was processed using ArcGIS Pro. The process included a few steps implemented as
a model \autoref{fig:processing_model}.
